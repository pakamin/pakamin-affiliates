5.0 out of 5 stars 

The best Roku so far, with some qualifications


Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020


I ordered my Ultra 2020 device directly from Roku, Amazon has reordered. It arrived on October 16, a day after the release date. I am using it to replace my Ultra 2018 model. I also have a second 4K TV with a Roku Streaming Stick + in addition to a Sharp Roku TV. Recently I have tried and set up Fire TV Cube. So along with our 2020 Ultra review, I'll be making comparisons. The 2020 Ultra is advertised as being 30 percent faster than previous versions. If so, I could barely notice. It's not worth an upgrade if your only motivation is speed and you already have the 2018 or 2019 Ultra. What it brings to the party is support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. I have a 4K TV and sound system that support both, so the upgrade was well worth it for me. I've found Dolby Vision (shown on many Netflix originals) to be better than standard HDR. If you aren't as bothered as I'm getting the most out of the picture quality, then you might not care about getting Dolby Vision. Fire TV Cube supports both Atmos and Dolby Vision, so this is an alternative of course. Personally, I prefer the Roku menu system. I found the Fire TV menu to be full of ads, and I was always flirting about the Prime Video-centric bias. I love Prime Video but I didn't like being forced to always look at Prime Video options first. Roku is a neutral displayer for display options. Another issue that I ran into with the Fire TV Cube was keeping audio to picture in sync. I had to disconnect the cube at least twice a day to re-sync the audio. This trick always worked, but it was a nuisance. I initially had a problem with audio syncing on the 2020 Ultra, but I managed to correct it in the settings. Ultra default setting for sound using "Auto Detect". I changed this sound setting to "auto pass" and that fixed the problem. The biggest improvement in the Ultra 2020 is its remote control. It features a volume control with a mute button. It has an audio search. It has four quick access apps: Hulu, Sling, Disney +, and Netflix. Plus, it has two programmable buttons, which I used for quick access to Prime Video and YouTube. The remote control is able to control both the TV and the audio receiver if both the TV and the audio receiver have HDMI-CEC capabilities turned on. Most newer devices have HDMI-CEC, but make sure your devices do if you expect your Roku remote to control your system. Compared to the Roku Streaming Stick +, which supports 4K and HDR, the Ultra has a wired LAN connection option as well as fast wifi with better range than previous Roku devices. Wired is always better if you have the ability. I also find that while the Ultra gets very warm, the Streaming Stick + gets quite hot. Streaming Stick + twice displayed an "overheating" warning. This makes me nervous. Finally, Roku devices, like the Fire TV Cube, can be controlled with Alexa. Just make sure to download the Roku Routine in the Alexa app and then turn on the Device Search to add the 2020 Ultra. Punchline: Roku Ultra 2020 is an excellent streaming device. The apps run faster and better than the apps on my LG SmartTV. The apps are also updated more frequently than the ones installed on the TV. Ultra 2020 is worth it provided you have or plan to buy a 4K TV that supports Dolby Vision and you also have a Dolby Atmos sound system. Otherwise, the Streaming Stick is half the price and almost the same speed. Fire TV options will be good for you if you mostly watch Prime Video and are comfortable with the Fire TV menu system with all its ads.

1.0 out of 5 stars does not connect directly to bluetooth headsets.


Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020


I got this new Roku unit  *specifically*  so I can connect Roku to my Bluetooth headphones. I don't want my phone (or any other device) in the middle ... I just want to listen to the audio from my Roku device via my Bluethooth speaker. Apple TV can do that, so it should be a no-brainer, right? Error!!!! I've tried for an hour now, and it's not working. I can call my phone, but what ... that's not what many of us want.

Hope this gets resolved but so far I'm in awe of this not working.

4.0 out of 5 stars Private listening break through distant. Customer service initially refused to help (see modifications)

Confirmed purchase
I've had multiple Roku devices over the years and I've been happy with the units. But luckily I haven't had to deal with Roku customer service before.

One of the reasons I bought the Ultra was the remote control listening function
