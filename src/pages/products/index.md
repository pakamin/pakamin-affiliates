  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .When I got my Roku 4, everything was good.
  However, it just seemed to deteriorate over time. 50% of the time when I would
  access it, it would need a restart because of the infamous purple screen, (you
  hear the audio, but your screen is a dense blanket of purple. It began slowing
  down also. However, once you finally get it going, it's still good.  I
  upgraded to the Roku Ultra 2020 yesterday and the hook up was very quick and
  so far it's working perfectly with no signs of screen purpility. Plus it's
  working notably faster than my previous model. It comes with the streaming
  player, an HDMI, the power source, the remote, batteries and a set of earplugs
  (wired). The only thing you have to do is sign up for a Roku account (for
  free), and then set up your channels. It comes with channels already set up, a
  lot I took off. I'm not using Sling, I won't be using ESPN, and so on. Plus, I
  have subscriptions to channels that need to be included, that I can find on
  the channels list. I still maintain that ROKU has the most freedom to design
  your player the way you see fit as far as what channels you wish to include,
  where their placement is, and what channels you don't want. Sure, ROKU will
  push Sling, but if you don't want it, you remove it.  This is my third ROKU
  player in maybe about 17 years. Over the years, and depending on which room I
  have the player, some of the channel apps may be different. When you are an
  existing ROKU account holder, when you activate your new ROKU player it will
  start downloading your channels automatically. Right now I have about 58
  channel apps on my ROKU, however my account says that I have 168 channels, and
  it starts downloading all of these channels. I don't know how to stop it. But
  luckily it did not take the 20 minutes or so that it usually takes. It was
  done in just about one minute. Probably because of the 2 Gigs of memory along
  with the updated processer, it went by lightning fast. It only took me a few
  minutes to delete all of the unneeded channels.  There are some downsides here
  that I've noticed. Although I do like the feel of this newly fashioned remote,
  it is much less responsive when using the volume button. I find that I have to
  point directly at the TV and at the correct angle in order to use this
  feature. There also seems to be a slight delay with response time when
  choosing channel apps with the remote. The remote for the ROKU 4 was
  immediate.  The improvements that I appreciate are some of the settings. First
  off I love that it now accepts the HDR/Dolby Vision video codecs. I definitely
  notice the difference in apps like VUDU. As far as I am concerned, my favorite
  upgrade is the audio options. While they say that this player is Dolby Atmos
  friendly, I thought I was able to get this with the ROKU 4. But, the option
  for audio pass-through is the setting I chose. This way there's no middle man,
  actually there's no need for it anyway. Now the audio passes through right to
  my soundbar, perfect option IMO.  But, I do like this player a lot. Is there a
  slight delay when choosing channels? Yes, however the speed in which the open
  and the fact that there are a lot less audio drops is a vast improvement for
  me. I understa
